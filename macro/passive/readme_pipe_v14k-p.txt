
Renaming of pipe_v14:
 14e->14k  - SIS-100
 14f->14l  - SIS-100 rich
 14g->14m  - SIS-300
 14h->14n  - SIS-300 rich
 14i->14o  - SIS-300
 14j->14p  - SIS-300 rich

pipe_v14k = pipe_v14e + fixed sizes of vacuum chamber for mvd_v14a


Short description of beam pipe geometries for SIS-100 (up to 600 cm):
 1) pipe_v14e.root - wide fixed beam pipe with 2.5deg half opening angle made of Al with thickness follows the formula: h=D(z)mm/60;
 2) pipe_v14f.root - the same as 1) excluding RICH section (1.7-3.7m);

Short  description of beam pipe geometries for SIS-300 (up to 880 cm):
 3) pipe_v14g.root - narrow fixed beam pipe with 1.6deg (0.22-3.7m) and 2.5deg (3.7-6.0m) half opening angles made of Al with thickness follows the formula: h=D(z)mm/60;
 4) pipe_v14h.root - the same as 3) excluding RICH section (1.7-3.7m);

 5) pipe_v14i.root - the same as 3) except first window@220mm and STS section (0.22-1.7m) that were made of Be with constant thickness h=0.5mm;
 6) pipe_v14j.root - the same as 5) excluding RICH section (1.7-3.7m);
