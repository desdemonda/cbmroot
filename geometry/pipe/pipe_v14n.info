SIS-300. Beam pipe geometry created with create_bpipe_geometry_v14n.C

	  pipe_v14n = pipe_v14h + fixed sizes of vacuum chamber for mvd_v14a

 The beam pipe is composed of aluminium with a thickness proportional to the
 diameter (D(z)mm/60). It is placed directly into the cave as mother volume.
 The beam pipe consists of few sections excluding RICH section (1700-3700mm)
 because it is part of the RICH geometry. Each section has a PCON shape 
 (including windows). There are two windows: first one @ 220mm with R600mm 
 and 0.7mm thickness, second one of iron @ 8800mm with R600mm and 0.2mm 
 thickness. The STS section is composed of cylinder D(z=220-500mm)=22mm and 
 cone (z=500-1700mm). The STS (conical part) and RICH sections have half 
 opening angle 1.6deg as a result of optimization. For downstream detectors 
 the half opening angle of sections is left the same (2.5deg) as in SIS-100 
 and section have cylindrical shape at z=6000-8800mm - it must be regarded 
 as an intermediate iteration, expecting feedback from subdetectors' groups.
 The PSD section of the beam pipe is missing because it is planned that it 
 will be part of PSD geometry.
