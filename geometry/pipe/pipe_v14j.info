SIS-300. Beam pipe geometry created with create_bpipe_geometry_v14j.C

 The beam pipe is composed of aluminium (excluding STS section (220-1700mm) 
 made of beryllium with constant thickness 0.5mm) with a thickness 
 proportional to the diameter (D(z)mm/60). It is placed directly into the 
 cave as mother volume. The beam pipe consists of few sections excluding 
 RICH section (1700-3700mm) because it is part of the RICH geometry. Each 
 section has a PCON shape (including windows). There are two windows: first 
 one @ 220mm with R600mm and 0.7mm thickness, second one of iron @ 8800mm 
 with R600mm and 0.2mm thickness. The STS section is composed of cylinder 
 D(z=220-500mm)=22mm and cone (z=500-1700mm). The STS (conical part) and 
 RICH sections have half opening angle 1.6deg as a result of optimization. 
 For downstream detectors the half opening angle of sections is left the 
 same (2.5deg) as in SIS-100 and section have cylindrical shape at z=6000-
 8800mm - it must be regarded as an intermediate iteration, expecting 
 feedback from subdetectors' groups. The PSD section of the beam pipe is 
 missing because it is planned that it will be part of PSD geometry.
